## 🌟 First-Timer Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>I'm not technical — can I still use Sage?</strong></summary>

Yes. Start with the **[⚡ Quick Start Guide](QUICKSTART.md)** for a minimal, copy/paste setup.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will this cost me money?</strong></summary>

Sage is designed to be **free to run**:

- **Software:** Free & Open Source.
- **AI Credits:** Sage uses **Bring Your Own Pollen (BYOP)**.
  - Server admins generate a key from [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai).
  - That key is used by the server for Sage’s AI requests.
- **Hosting:** If you self-host, you pay only for your own infrastructure (if any).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this safe for my Discord server?</strong></summary>

Sage is built to be transparent and controllable:

- 🔒 **You control settings** (logging, tracing, retention)
- 👁️ **Open source** — behavior is reviewable
- ⚙️ **Privacy controls** — you can disable ingestion/logging

See **[Security &amp; Privacy](security_privacy.md)** for concrete details on what’s stored and how to disable it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I get stuck during setup?</strong></summary>

Try these in order:

1. Run `npm run doctor`
2. Check **[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**
3. Re-run the onboarding wizard: `npm run onboard`
4. If still blocked, open a GitHub issue

## 📖 About Sage

<details>
<summary><strong>What is Sage?</strong></summary>

Sage is a fully agentic AI companion. Unlike simple chatbots, Sage aims to behave like a helpful community member who **listens and evolves alongside you**.

- 🧠 **Personalized touch**: Remembers context to respond more helpfully over time.
- 👥 **Socially aware**: Understands relationships and the “vibe” of a server.
- 📄 **Knowledgeable**: Can ingest files and discuss them with the community.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Sage free to use?</strong></summary>

Yes — Sage is free and open source. It uses [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai) for AI capabilities, which offers free API access. If you self-host, you only pay for your own hosting costs (which can be $0).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What AI models does Sage use?</strong></summary>

Sage uses a multi-model pipeline:

- **Router:** Gemini-Fast (Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite) for high-precision context analysis.
- **Chat:** Gemini (default), or any model available on Pollinations.
- **Analysis:** DeepSeek for user profile analysis.
- **Summaries:** OpenAI-Large for channel summaries.
- **Formatting:** Qwen-Coder for structured JSON output.

You can change defaults in **[Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md)**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Sage read files?</strong></summary>

Yes. Sage supports file ingestion for:

- Code files (`.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, etc.)
- Text documents (`.txt`, `.md`)

Sage uses file contents to help answer questions (e.g., code review, explanations). *PDF support is planned for a future update.*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can Sage see images?</strong></summary>

Yes. If you share an image and trigger Sage, it can analyze the image using vision-capable models.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does Sage work with voice chat?</strong></summary>

Sage has **Voice Awareness**: it can answer questions like who is in voice and how long someone has been in voice.

Sage does not listen to or transcribe voice conversations.

## 🔧 Setup & Configuration

3. **Reply**: reply to one of Sage’s messages

</details>

## 🔴 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Sage is slow to respond</strong></summary>

Possible causes:

- High-precision routing (resolving context across history)
- Large context ingestion (e.g., long files)
- Provider load

Things to try:

- Wait a few seconds (complex requests take longer)
- Ensure a BYOP key is set for higher limits / priority
