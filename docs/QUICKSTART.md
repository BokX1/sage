# ⚡ Quick Start Guide

**Sage is the first Discord AI agent that pays for itself—literally.**

You have two options to use Sage:

1. **🤖 Use the Public Bot (Recommended):** Zero setup, free hosting, vision support, "Bring Your Own Pollen" (BYOP).
2. **💻 Self-Host:** For developers who want full control over the code, infrastructure, and vision models.

## Option 1: Use the Public Bot (Zero Setup) 🚀

**Best for:** Community managers, gamers, and non-developers.

### 1. Invite Sage

[**Click here to invite Sage to your server**](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1462117382398017667&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=8)  
*(Note: Replace with your actual invite link if different)*

### 2. Activate Sage (Server-Wide Key)

Sage uses a **"Bring Your Own Pollen"** model. The bot hosting is free, but you provide the AI credits (Pollen) from Pollinations.ai.

**As a Server Admin:**

1. Type `/sage key login` in Discord.
2. Click the link to log in to Pollinations.ai (it's free).
3. Copy your key from the browser URL (it looks like `sk_...`).
4. Type `/sage key set <your_key>`.

**Done!** Sage will now work for **everyone** in your server using your key.

## Option 2: Self-Host (For Developers) 🛠️

**Best for:** Developers, privacy enthusiasts, or customizing the codebase.

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **Docker Desktop** (for the database)
- **Discord Bot Token**

### 2. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BokX1/Sage.git
cd Sage
npm install
```

### 3. Configure

Run the interactive wizard:

```bash
npm run onboard
```

> ℹ️ The wizard can set a global `POLLINATIONS_API_KEY`. If you skip it, run `/sage key set` later to activate per server.

### 4. Start

```bash
docker compose -f config/ci/docker-compose.yml up -d db
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

You should see: `Logged in as Sage#1234` and `Ready!`.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- **"Rate limit hit"**: If using the public bot without a key, you might hit the free tier limits. Add a key to lift them.
- **"Invalid API Key"**: Make sure you copied the `sk_...` part correctly from the URL.
