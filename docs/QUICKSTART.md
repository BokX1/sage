## Option 1: Use the public bot (recommended)

**Best for:** Most servers that want Sage running immediately.

### 1) Invite Sage

[**Invite Sage to your server**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1211723232808570971&permissions=414464731200&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

> [!TIP]
> Prefer least-privilege permissions? You can generate a custom invite URL with only the permissions you want (see [Getting Started → Invite Bot](GETTING_STARTED.md#step-6-invite-sage-to-your-server)).

### 2) Activate BYOP (server-wide key)

Sage uses **Bring Your Own Pollen (BYOP)**: hosting is free, and your server provides a Pollinations key.

As a server admin (or someone with **Manage Guild** permission):

1. Run `/sage key login`
2. Open the link and log in to Pollinations.ai
3. Copy the `sk_...` key from the URL
4. Run `/sage key set <your_key>`

After this, Sage is active for the entire server.

### 3) Try it

- `/ping`
- `/sage whoiswho`
- Say “Sage, hello” (wake word)
- Mention `@Sage`
- Reply to a Sage message

## Option 2: Self-host (developers)

**Best for:** Customizing the codebase, running private instances, or controlling infra.

Follow **[📖 Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md)** for a complete walkthrough (Discord app, `.env`, database, onboarding wizard, and invite generation).

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting (fast)

- **Rate limits / shared quota:** Set a BYOP key with `/sage key login` → `/sage key set`.
- **Invalid API key:** Make sure you copied the `sk_...` value correctly from the URL.
- **Bot is online but silent:** Check wake word / mentions, and verify permissions in the channel.

For deeper debugging, see **[🔧 Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**.
