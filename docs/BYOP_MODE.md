# 🌸 Bring Your Own Pollen (BYOP)

Sage uses a community-friendly model: **the bot is free to host, and communities provide the “brain power” (API key).**

This keeps Sage sustainable and enables higher limits for your server.

## 🔑 How It Works

Sage needs an API key (“Pollen”) to generate responses. This can be provided in two ways:

1. **Server-wide key (BYOP)**: **(Standard)** A server admin sets a specific key for their community using `/sage key set`.
2. **Host-level key (`.env`)**: **(Optional)** The bot owner sets a default key for all servers.

This key is used for:

- 💬 Text chat (default)
- 👁️ Vision (image understanding)
- 🎨 Image generation & editing
- 🎤 Voice-related features (where enabled)

## 🚀 Setup Guide (For Admins)

**Prerequisite:** You must be a Server Admin or have the **Manage Guild** permission.

### Step 1: Get Your Key

Run:

```text
/sage key login
```

Open the link, sign in via Pollinations (GitHub), then copy the key from the URL (starts with `sk_`).

> [!TIP]
> You can also manage/create keys directly from the Pollinations dashboard at `enter.pollinations.ai`.

### Step 2: Activate Sage (server-wide)

Run:

```text
/sage key set <your_key>
```

That’s it — Sage is active for the whole server. 🎉

## 🔐 Key Safety Notes

- The key is **server-wide** and used for requests originating from that server.
- Treat your `sk_...` key like a password.
- If you need to revoke access, run `/sage key clear` and/or rotate the key in Pollinations.
