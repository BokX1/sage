Sage uses different models for specialized tasks:

| Task | Model | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chat** | `gemini` (configurable) | Main conversations with users |
| **Profile Analysis** | `deepseek` | Building user memory profiles |
| **Summaries** | `openai-large` | Channel conversation summaries |
| **JSON Formatting** | `qwen-coder` | Structured data extraction |
| **Voice** | `openai-audio` | Text-to-speech companion responses |

> [!NOTE]
> You can override these defaults in `.env`. See [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for the full list.

## 🌸 BYOP: Keys in Discord

Sage supports BYOP (Bring Your Own Pollen) via Discord commands:

1. Run `/sage key login`
2. Follow the link and log in to Pollinations.ai
3. Copy the `sk_...` key from the URL
4. Run `/sage key set <key>`

This sets a **server-wide key** used for all AI requests from that server.

For a step-by-step guide, see **[BYOP Mode](BYOP_MODE.md)**.

## ⚙️ Host Configuration (`.env`)

If you self-host, you can set defaults in `.env`:

```env
POLLINATIONS_MODEL=gemini
# POLLINATIONS_API_KEY provides a global fallback if a server key is not set.
```

### Override models for specific tasks

```env
# Main chat model
POLLINATIONS_MODEL=gemini

# Profile memory updates
PROFILE_POLLINATIONS_MODEL=deepseek

# Channel summaries
SUMMARY_MODEL=openai-large

# JSON formatting
FORMATTER_MODEL=qwen-coder
```

---

## 🧪 Discover available models

You can view available models during onboarding:

```bash
npm run onboard
# Type "list" when prompted for model selection
```
