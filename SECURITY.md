## Security Best Practices

When deploying Sage:

### Environment Variables

- **Never commit** `.env` files with real credentials
- Use environment variable management in production (secrets managers)
- Rotate your `DISCORD_TOKEN` if you suspect compromise

### Database

- Use strong passwords for PostgreSQL
- Restrict database access to the bot's IP only
- Regularly backup your database

### API Keys

- Keep your `POLLINATIONS_API_KEY` private
- Generate keys with minimal required permissions
- Revoke and regenerate keys periodically

### Discord Bot Permissions

- Use the **minimum permissions** required
- Avoid granting Administrator permission in production
- Regularly audit the bot's role permissions

## Known Security Considerations

### Data Storage

Sage stores the following data:

- User messages (configurable retention)
- User profiles (AI-generated summaries)
- Voice channel session data
- Relationship graph data

See [Security & Privacy](docs/security_privacy.md) for full details.
