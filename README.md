## 🎯 What is Sage?

Sage is a **fully agentic Discord companion** that goes beyond simple chat commands. Unlike traditional bots, Sage is designed to be a friendly member of your community who **listens and evolves alongside you**:

- 🧠 **Self-Learning Memory**: Remembers past conversations to build personalized user contexts.
- 👥 **Socially Aware**: Understands relationship tiers (Best Friend, Acquaintance) and interaction "vibes."
- 👁️ **Vision & Image Analysis**: Ingests images to discuss visual content and extract information.
- 📄 **Knowledge Base**: Ingests code files and text documents to provide expert-level analysis.
- 💬 **Intelligent Routing**: Uses a high-precision LLM classifier to resolve pronouns and context.

**Perfect for:** Coding communities • Gaming groups • Research teams • Any Discord that wants a bot that "gets it."

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option A: Use the public bot

1. **Invite Sage**

   [**Click here to invite Sage to your server**](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1211723232808570971&permissions=414464731200&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

2. **Activate BYOP (recommended for higher limits)**

   - Run `/sage key login` to get your Pollinations key.
   - Run `/sage key set <your_key>` to activate Sage for the entire server.

> [!TIP]
> Prefer least-privilege permissions? Generate a custom invite URL in the Discord Developer Portal (see [Getting Started → Invite Bot](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#step-6-invite-sage-to-your-server)).

### Option B: Self-host from source

Follow **[📖 Getting Started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)** for a full walkthrough (Node.js, Docker/Postgres, onboarding wizard, and invite generation).
