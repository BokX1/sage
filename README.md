# Sage

[![CI](https://github.com/BokX1/Sage/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BokX1/Sage/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Sage** is a context-aware Discord bot that remembers conversations, tracks relationships, and generates personalized responses using LLM-powered intelligence.

---

## What Sage Does

Sage is built to give Discord communities a reliable, memory-aware assistant. It combines persistent memory, social graph analysis, and channel summaries to produce richer, more personalized replies.

### Key Capabilities

- **User Memory** — Learns and recalls preferences, interests, and conversation history.
- **Relationship Graph** — Builds probabilistic relationships based on mentions, replies, and voice activity.
- **Channel Summaries** — Maintains rolling summaries to give the model compact context.
- **Voice Awareness** — Tracks voice joins, leaves, and overlap sessions.
- **Agentic Routing** — Routes requests through a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with tracing.
