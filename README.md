## 🎯 What is Sage?

Sage is a **Fully Agentic Discord companion** that goes beyond simple chat commands. Unlike traditional bots, Sage is designed to be a friendly member of your community who **listens and evolves alongside you**:

- 🧠 **Self-Learning Memory**: Remembers past conversations to build personalized user contexts.
- 👥 **Socially Aware**: Understands relationship tiers (Best Friend, Acquaintance) and interaction "vibes."
- 📄 **Knowledge Base**: Ingests code files and text documents to provide expert-level analysis.
- 💬 **Intelligent Routing**: Uses a high-precision LLM classifier to resolve pronouns and context.

**Perfect for:** Coding communities • Gaming groups • Research teams • Any Discord that wants a bot that "gets it."
